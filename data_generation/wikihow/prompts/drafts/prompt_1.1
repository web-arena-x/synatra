You are given an article about how to perform a web-based task and your goal is to implement it in Python with the given actions.

Here are the available actions implemented in Python:
```python
def click(element: str):
    """Click the element specified by the 'element'"""
    pass

def type(field: str, content: str):
    """
    Type the content into the field specified by the field argument
    :param field: name or the description of the field
    :param content: text to be entered
    """
    pass

def press(key_comb: str):
    """
    Press the key or key combinations specified by the key_comb argument
    :param key_comb: key or key combinations
    """
    pass

def scroll(direction: str):
    """
    scroll the page up or down
    :param direction: up or down
    """
    assert direction in ["up", "down"]
    pass

def new_tab():
    """
    Open a new tab
    """
    pass

def tab_focus(tab_index: int):
    """
    Focus on the tab specified by the tab_index argument
    :param tab_index: index number of the tab to be focused if there are multiple open tabs
    """
    pass

def close_tab():
    """
    Close the current tab
    """
    pass

def goto(url: str):
    """
    Go to the url specified by the url argument
    :param url: specific url
    """
    pass

def go_back():
    """
    Go back to the previous page
    """
    pass

def go_forward():
    """
    Go forward to the next page
    """
    pass
```

Implementation Guideline:
1. Stay focused: Stick strictly to the primary topic. If the original piece presents multiple scenarios, use your discretion to select the single most relevant and straightforward one for your implementation.
2. Use concrete examples in your implementations: You always want to imagine concrete scenarios. That is, you want to have concrete values for each argument in the action other than a generic description.
3. Standardize to Chrome browser: Adapt all examples to fit the context of the Chrome browser on a laptop. If the original article is based on other platforms, like mobile phones, desktop app, tablet, draw on your expertise to translate those instructions to a Chrome browser setting.
4. Implement the step-by-step Where the steps in the original article offers a high-level overview, break it down into comprehensive step-by-step actions. Ensure that each step is straightforward, actionable, and easy to follow.

Task: Choose recipients for an email in Gmail

Article:
Open Gmail. Go to https://www.gmail.com/ in your computer's web browser. This will open your Gmail inbox if you're logged in.
If you aren't logged into your Gmail account, enter your email address and password when prompted.

Click Compose. It's in the upper-left side of your Gmail inbox. Doing so opens a "New Message" window in the lower-right corner of the page.If you're using the old version of Gmail, you'll click COMPOSE here instead.

Enter the other person's email address. Click the "To" or "Recipients" text box at the top of the New Message window, then type in the email address of the person to whom you want to send your email. To add multiple email addresses, type in the first email address, press Tab, and repeat with the other email addresses. If you want to CC or BCC someone on the email, click either the Cc link or the Bcc link in the far-right side of the "To" text field, then type the email address you want to CC or BCC into the "Cc" or "Bcc" text field, respectively.

## Implementation
I will follow the guidelins and implement the article in Python.
```python
# Go to Gmail website
goto(url="https://mail.google.com")
# Click the "Compose" button
click(element="Compose")
# Enter the email address of the recipient "healthy_life@gmail" in the "To" field
type(field="To", content="healthy_life@gmail.com")
# Expand the "To" field by clicking the "Expand More" button
click(element="Expand More")
# Enter the email address of the CC recipient "happy_vocation@gmail" in the "Cc" field
type(field="Cc", content="happy_vocation@gmail.com")
```

Implement the following article in Python:
Task: Download Songs, Albums, and Playlists from Spotify

Original article:
Open the Spotify app on your PC or Mac. Click or double-click the Spotify app icon, which is three black, horizontal bars on a green background. If you haven't already downloaded the Spotify desktop app, you can get it from https://www.spotify.com/us/download.

Create a playlist if you want to download individual songs (optional). You can only download albums and playlists from Spotify, not individual songs. If you don't want an entire existing playlist or a full album, you can just add the songs you want to download to a new playlist. Here's how: Click + Create Playlist in the left panel. Click My Playlist, type a name for the playlist, and then tap Save. Add songs to the playlist by dragging them to the new playlist. You can also click the three dots on any song, select Add to playlist, and select your new playlist name.

Select a playlist or album. This displays all of the songs on the selected playlist or album.

Click the gray download arrow at the top of the playlist or album. If the arrow inside of a circle at the top of the playlist or album is gray, click it to start the download. The arrow will turn green once the download is complete. When a song finishes downloading, it will have a downward-facing arrow icon to the right of it.

Listen to Spotify music offline. Whenever you're not connected to the internet, you can open Spotify, click your downloaded playlist, and click the "Play" icon to the left of a song to play it. If you want to stay connected to the internet but not use your internet connection to listen, you can turn on Offline Mode. On Windows, click the File menu and choose Offline Mode. On a Mac, click the Spotify menu and choose Offline Mode.
Click the gray download arrow at the top of the playlist or album. If the arrow inside of a circle at the top of the playlist or album is gray, click it to start the download. The arrow will turn green once the download is complete. When a song finishes downloading, it will have a downward-facing arrow icon to the right of it.

Listen to Spotify music offline. Whenever you're not connected to the internet, you can open Spotify, click your downloaded playlist, and click the "Play" icon to the left of a song to play it. If you want to stay connected to the internet but not use your internet connection to listen, you can turn on Offline Mode. On Windows, click the File menu and choose Offline Mode. On a Mac, click the Spotify menu and choose Offline Mode.
